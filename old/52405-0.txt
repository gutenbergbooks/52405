=MEG LANGHOLME=, or the Day after To-morrow. By Mrs MOLESWORTH, author
of _Philippa_, _Olivia_, _Blanche_, _Carrots_, _Imogen_, &c. With eight
Illustrations by W. Rainey. =5/=

  Mrs Molesworth with her usual charm of manner, and easy natural
  grace, traces the development of Meg Langholme from early girlhood
  to young womanhood, with her friends and companions in the home of
  Bray Weald, where she is like an adopted daughter, until mysterious
  warnings bode the disaster of her life; for certain reasons she is
  kidnapped and concealed until cleverly rescued, and happily married
  to a lifelong friend then home from India.

=VINCE THE REBEL=, or the Sanctuary in the Bog. By GEORGE MANVILLE

  Relates the troubles at Mere Abbey, a fine South-of-England mansion,
  surrounded by bogs and woodlands, during the reign of James II. of
  England, and how Vince the Rebel lay in hiding here after Sedgemoor,
  and escaped the soldiers sent in pursuit. The free and healthy

  Sol Bogg, the man-servant, who aids in all the fishing, hunting, and

  readers of all ages.

  being Kitty Malone from Castle Malone in Ireland, who earns
  the nickname of Wild Kitty because of her love of mischief and
  unconventional manners. Mrs Meade is herself a native of Ireland and
  quite at home in sketching such a character, and she does not fail
  to weave a fascinating narrative, and one which she herself believes
  will rank amongst her best efforts.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
